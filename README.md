# ClientBlocker
Allows you to block certain clients from joining your server

This plugin allows you to block clients from connecting to your Minecraft server.

This is extremely easy to bypass and you are most likely only blocking the good guys, but maybe it will be useful to some.

Example Config:
```yaml
kick-message: Modified clients are not allowed on this server
allowed-clients:
- vanilla
- fabric
```
